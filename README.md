# Creating-BarChart-tableau
Simple steps to creating a barchart using community data. 
Bar charts could be used to compare data across categories.


1. Highlighted at the bottom of the left side of the screen is "Sheet 1", right click it.

2. A left click will give you the opportunity to rename "Sheet 1" to a more descriptive name.

3. Time to add some filters to our data. Look up 'state' in the search bar, drag and drop "State" data under the "Additional Measure Data" table to the red underlined box titled "Filters." You will get a pop-up screen where you could filter the data to the state of your preference, for this instance we will go with Arizona data.

4. Look for the variable "Food insecurity" under the Additional Measere Data, table. Drag and drop the "Food insecurity" to the Rows box the red arrow is pointing at. 
Repeat the process but with the variable "County" under the Additional Measere Data, table. But this time drag and drop "County" to the Columns box.

>The 2022 County Health Rankings included food insecurity as a health risk.
Food insecurity means there is a lack of consistent food, the limited access to food increases the chances of negative health outcomes like weight-gain, or premature death. Food insecurity also measures the ability of individuals and families to secure balanced meals.


5. You now have a barchart that displays the SUM of people facing food insecurity in each county in Arizona. The NULL could be excluded for presenstation purposes.
