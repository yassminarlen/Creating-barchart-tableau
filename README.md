# Creating-BarChart-tableau
Simple steps to creating a barchart using community data. 
Bar charts could be used to compare data across categories.


1. Highlighted at the bottom of the left side of the screen is "Sheet 1", right click it.

2. A left click will give you the opportunity to rename "Sheet 1" to a more descriptive name.

3. Time to add some filters to our data. Look up 'state' in the search bar, drag and drop "State" data under the "Additional Measure Data" table to the red underlined box titled "Filters." You will get a pop-up screen where you could filter the data to the state of your preference, for this instance we will go with Arizona data.

4. Look for the variable "Food insecurity" under the Additional Measere Data, table. Drag and drop the "Food insecurity %"(*The percentage of the population who did not have access to a reliable source of food*) to the Rows box the red arrow is pointing at. 
Repeat the process but with the variable "County" under the Additional Measere Data, table. But this time drag and drop "County" to the Columns box.

5. It is important to exclude the null from our bar chart to prevent ambiguous interpretations. To exclude the null right click the bar labeled "null", then click "exclude" to remove it from the bar chart.

6. From the barchart it could be concluded that Apache, Navajo, and Yuma are the counties with the highest percentages of food insecurity in Arizona. This could be explained by a lack of accessibility, individual resources, and/or neighborhood level resources.

## The 2022 County Health Rankings included food insecurity as a health risk.
Food insecurity means there is a lack of consistent food, the limited access to food increases the chances of negative health outcomes like weight-gain, or premature death. Food insecurity also measures the ability of individuals and families to secure balanced meals  (Food Insecurity*, n.d.). 

The U.S. The Department of Agriculture debriefs that there are a variety of factors that go into measuring food insecurity but that the following are always considered.

-Accessibility to sources of healthy food, as measured by distance to a store or by the number of stores in an area.

-Individual-level resources that may affect accessibility, such as family income or vehicle availability.

-Neighborhood-level indicators of resources, such as the average income of the neighborhood and the availability of public transportation (USDA ERS - Documentation, n.d.).
